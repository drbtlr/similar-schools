# Identifying Similar Schools

This repository contains web guides, R code, and sample data to help education data analysts identify schools that are similar to each other in terms of student enrollment, faculty and staff characteristics, programs, spending and funding, and other school indicators that are publicly available on state and district report cards. Using data from the [Kentucky school report card](https://openhouse.education.ky.gov/SRC), this guide shows how unsupervised machine learning methods can be applied to publicly available data to gain insights into schools and districts across a state. This project is inspired by a similar project by [Albuquerque Public Schools](https://www.aps.edu/sapr). This material can also be accessed on the
OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use).

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the R code of the analysis (and renders the guide)
- `R` contains R functions necessary to complete the analysis
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `img` contains images to format the guides
- `includes` contains style assets to format the guides
- `man` contains the manuals and descriptive files of the data

These materials were originally authored by Aaron Butler.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education
analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school
systems. The community is hosted by the
[Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the
[Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu).
We welcome contributions and feedback.
